          I am <strong>Pema Choden</strong>, a proud Bhutanese student currently pursuing a 
          Bachelor of Education in Information Technology (B.Ed IT) at 
          Samtse College of Education, under the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB). 
          At present, I am in my third year of study, passionately learning, growing, 
          and preparing myself to become a future educator who can inspire and empower 
          young minds in the field of ICT.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Trashigang, a place I fondly call home. I come 
          from a humble yet supportive family whose unwavering love, guidance, 
          and encouragement continue to shape me into who I am today. Their values 
          have instilled in me the spirit of hard work, perseverance, and gratitudeâ€”
          qualities I carry with me in both my academic journey and personal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my academic aspirations, I am a person who finds joy and meaning 
          in simple yet fulfilling activities. I am an avid reader of novels, as 
          books allow me to explore worlds beyond imagination and broaden my perspectives. 
          I also enjoy watching movies, which not only entertain me but also teach me 
          valuable lessons about life, culture, and creativity. Moreover, I love taking 
          walks amidst nature, as they bring me peace, clarity, and inspiration, 
          reminding me of the simple beauty of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue this journey, I aspire to grow as a learner, a teacher, and an 
          individual who can make a positive difference. My dream is not only to share 
          knowledge but also to inspire curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking 
          in the learners I will guide in the future.
