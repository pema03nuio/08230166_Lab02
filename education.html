          I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Education in Information Technology (B.Ed IT) 
          at Samtse College of Education, under the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB). Being in 
          my third year of study, I am deeply engaged in learning both theoretical and practical 
          aspects of ICT, alongside the pedagogical skills required to become a competent teacher. 
          This program has not only enhanced my knowledge of technology but has also shaped me 
          into a reflective learner who aspires to inspire future generations.

        <p>
          From 2019 to 2021, I studied at Bartsham Central School, where I successfully completed 
          my Higher Secondary education. My time there was filled with valuable learning experiences, 
          both academic and co-curricular. I had the honor of being appointed as the class captain in 
          Grade 11 and later the house captain in Grade 12, roles that helped me develop leadership 
          qualities, responsibility, and a spirit of service. These experiences left a lasting impact 
          on my confidence and ability to work collaboratively with peers and teachers alike.

        <p>
          My educational foundation was built at Bidung Lower Secondary School, 
          from Pre-Primary to 10th year, where I studied from 2008 to 2018. The school 
          provided me with not only academic basics but also values of humility, perseverance, 
          and respect for others. The friendships, teachers, and experiences from Bidung 
          school remain an integral part of my journey, shaping the student and individual I am today.
